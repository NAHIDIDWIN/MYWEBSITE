        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and problem-solve like humans. AI can process data, learn from it, and make decisions or predictions without explicit programming for every task. AI technology powers a variety of systems we encounter daily, from voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to advanced robotics.</p>

    <section id="history" class="history">
        <h2>History of AI</h2>
        <p>The concept of AI dates back to ancient Greece, but the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. Early research focused on problem-solving and symbolic methods, with significant milestones in the 1950s and 1960s. However, progress slowed due to high expectations and limited computing power in the 1970s, a period referred to as the "AI winter." The 21st century has seen remarkable advancements due to improvements in algorithms, data availability, and computational power, leading to AI's rapid growth and integration into everyday technology.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="types" class="types">
        <h2>Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>AI can be categorized into different types based on its functionality and capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Narrow AI (Weak AI)</strong>: AI systems designed for specific tasks, such as facial recognition or speech recognition. They excel at a particular function but lack general intelligence.</li>
            <li><strong>General AI (Strong AI)</strong>: A hypothetical form of AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a wide range of tasks, similar to human cognitive abilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</strong>: A more advanced stage of AI that surpasses human intelligence in every aspect, including creativity, problem-solving, and social intelligence. It is still a theoretical concept.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="applications" class="applications">
        <h2>Applications of AI</h2>
        <p>AI is revolutionizing numerous industries. Some of the key applications of AI include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: AI assists in diagnosing diseases, personalizing treatment plans, and analyzing medical images.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance</strong>: AI powers fraud detection systems, automated trading, and customer service bots in banking and financial services.</li>
            <li><strong>Retail</strong>: AI helps companies predict consumer behavior, optimize inventory management, and provide personalized shopping experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation</strong>: AI is used in autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems, making transportation more efficient and safer.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Service</strong>: AI chatbots are now widely used to provide round-the-clock customer support in various industries.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="impact" class="impact">
        <h2>Impact of AI on Society</h2>
        <p>The rapid development of AI brings both opportunities and challenges. On the positive side, AI can increase efficiency, create new industries, and improve quality of life through advancements in healthcare, education, and automation. However, concerns over job displacement, data privacy, and ethical considerations must be addressed to ensure that AI benefits society as a whole. Ensuring AI systems are transparent, accountable, and designed to serve human interests will be key to mitigating potential risks.</p>
